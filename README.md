## <h1><center>About this Repository:</center></h1>

This repository contains the work required for the Fundamentals of Data Analysis Module, as part of the Higher Diploma in Science in Computing in Data Analytics - Atlantic Technology University.  

The work is divided into two main folders:

1- Normal Distribution: This folder contains the a research project, which investigates and explores the Normal Distribution.

2 - Practicals: This folder contains the weekly tasks assigned to students throughout the course of the module.

## <h1><center>Running the Files:</center></h1>

Written in the programming language Python and presented in a Jupyter Notebook, all files can be viewed and edited on a local machine using a Python interpreter, such as VS Code.  Alternatively they can be run with Jupyter Notebook.  

## <h1><center>1. Normal Distribution Task:</center></h1>

In this project I will be exploring the Normal Distribution. 

The exploration will include:

Creating a notebook about the normal distribution.

1 - Define and explain the main concepts.

2 - Discussing its uses in the real world.

3 - Making visuals like plots to explain the concepts.

4 - A brief overview of other types of distributions.
