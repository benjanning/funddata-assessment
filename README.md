# <h1><center>Normal Distribution Project for the Fundamentals of Data Analysis Module</center></h1>

## <h1><center>Introduction:</center></h1>

In this project I will be exploring the Normal Distribution. 

The exploration will include:

Creating a notebook about the normal distribution.
1 - Define and explain the main concepts.
2 - Discussing its uses in the real world.
3 - Making visuals like plots to explain the concepts.
4 - A brief overview of other types of distributions.

## <h1><center>Running the Project:</center></h1>

Written in the programming language Python and presented in a Jupyter Notebook, this file can be viewed and edited on a local machine using a Python interpreter, such as VS Code.  Alternaitively it can be run with Jupyter Notebook.  

## <h1><center>Table of Contents:</center></h1>

1) What is the Normal Distribution?
2) How to Recognise a Normal Distribution
3) Why is the Normal Distribution Important?
4) How Did Normal Distribution Receive its Name?
5) Different Types of Averages
6) The Empirical Rule
7) Code Examples of Normal Distribution
8) The Z-Score
9) The Z-Table
10) Central Limit Theorem
11) Outliers
12) Other Forms of Statistical Distribution
13) Conclusion
